# About Me

I started my journey into software development through Enspiral Dev Academy, realising pretty quickly that I had finally found a career that I was incredibly passionate and enthused about.

My background includes various sales, inventory and management roles within the retail industry. I have been through an eclectic mix of companies and experienced a range of positions, which drove me to the stage of wanting to find something completely different that I really had a deep passion for.

I've always had a growing interest in technology since a young age, especially in the realm of computer software and having a general interest in the internet.
This is what led me to explore my passion towards technology, which ended up with an immersive 15 week software development bootcamp through Enspiral Dev Academy.

Now that I have come out of this bootcamp as a full stack software developer, it has really grasped my passion and interest in the industry and am excited to see what's around the corner in terms of my career.
