I started my journey into software development through Enspiral Dev Academy, realising pretty quickly that I had finally found a career that I was incredibly passionate and enthused about.

My background includes various sales, inventory and management roles within the retail industry. I have been through an eclectic mix of companies and experienced a range of positions, which drove me to the stage of wanting to find something completely different that I really had a deep passion for.

I've always had a growing interest in technology since a young age, especially in the realm of computer software and having a general interest in the internet.
This is what led me to explore my passion towards software development, which ended up with an immersive 15 week bootcamp through Enspiral Dev Academy.

Now that I have come out of this bootcamp as a full stack software developer, it has really grasped my passion and interest in the industry and am excited to see what's around the corner in terms of my career.

## Projects

I have a collection of work on my Github, which is a mix of group projects and personal projects. Most of these are short projects that were completed to deadlines of anywhere between 1-7 days. My commits are a bit gappy from November-March, due to working on code amongst peers. There are also a few ongoing projects detailed below.

### Swopzies

Swopzies is a free to use website for people looking to trade goods and services with no money involved.

As the product owner of Swopzies, I wanted to create a website that had the community in mind. I believe this is a great idea to bring the community together, barter your skills/services and even swap a tasty bottle of homebrew with a jar of honey from the beekeeper down the road.

I worked in a fantastic and diverse team of six others, building what is now Swopzies in less than a week. The final product was presented on graduation at Enspiral Dev Academy, but is still a work in progress.

### This or That

This or That is a personal project of mine that is just in its beginning stages.
It's a simple game of comparing two different things (eg. iOS or Android) and seeing what percentage of people choose either option.
There will be added functionality of commenting, user stats, creating your own comparisons etc.

## Other Stuff

I'm currently in the midst of starting a new group project to create a product for a "dummy" client.
This is a product we're creating in the hopes of it being used, specifically in the art world.

I am also looking into furthering my knowledge with new languages. 
**Swift** and **Python** are two languages I'm currently looking in to, as Python is so widely used and I also want to branch into iOS development.
