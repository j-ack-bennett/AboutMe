## About me

I started my journey into software development through a 15 week intensive bootcamp with Enspiral Dev Academy. I realised pretty quickly after starting, that I had finally found a career in which I was incredibly passionate and enthused about.

My background includes various sales, inventory and management roles within the retail industry. I have been through an eclectic mix of companies and experienced a range of positions, which drove me to the stage of wanting to find something completely different that I really had a deep passion for.

I've always had an interest in technology since a young age, having grown up using both Apple and Microsoft products. I was specifically intrigued with how desktop and web applications worked on both systems, which helped develop my interest even further into how the software operated behind closed doors.
This was the spark that led me to explore my discovered passion towards software development.

Now that I have come out of this bootcamp as a full stack software developer, it has really grasped my passion and interest in the tech industry. 
I am excited to see what's around the corner in terms of technology and to see how I can make a positive change!

## Projects

I have a collection of work on my Github, which is a mix of group projects and personal projects. Most of these are short projects that were completed to deadlines of anywhere between 1-7 days. My commits are a bit gappy from November-March, due to working on code amongst peers. There are also a few ongoing projects detailed below.

### Swopzies

Swopzies is a free to use website for people looking to trade goods and services with no money involved.

As the product owner of Swopzies, I wanted to create a website that had the community in mind. I believe this is a great idea to bring the community together, barter your skills/services and even swap a tasty bottle of homebrew with a jar of honey from the beekeeper down the road.

I worked in a fantastic and diverse team of six others, building what is now Swopzies in less than a week. The final product was presented on graduation at Enspiral Dev Academy, but is still a work in progress.

### This or That

This or That is a personal project of mine that is just in its beginning stages.

It's a simple click-based game to compare two different things (eg. iOS or Android) and see what percentage of people choose either option.

There will be added functionality of commenting, user stats, creating your own comparisons etc.

## Other Stuff

I have a very keen interest in developing my skills for mobile development, specifically iOS.
I've recently started learning **Swift** and am excited to see what projects I can create from this versatile language.
